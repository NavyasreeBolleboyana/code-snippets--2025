Script Type

Client Script — onChange

This is an onChange client script in ServiceNow that runs automatically whenever the user changes the value of the Location (u_location) field on a form.
It uses the reference value of that location to check its state and dynamically updates the Preferred Language (preferred_language) field options in real time — without needing to reload the form.
